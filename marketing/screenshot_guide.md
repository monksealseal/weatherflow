## Screenshot Tips

1. **Browser**: Use Chrome in incognito (clean, no extensions)
2. **Window size**: 1920x1080 or 1440x900
3. **Zoom**: 100% (no zoom)
4. **Theme**: Use the default light theme (better for LinkedIn)
5. **Data**: Use interesting-looking sample data, not boring defaults

## Tools for Screenshots

- **macOS**: Cmd+Shift+4 (select area) or Cmd+Shift+5 (screen record)
- **Windows**: Win+Shift+S (Snipping Tool)
- **Chrome**: DevTools → Cmd+Shift+P → "Capture full size screenshot"
- **Professional**: CleanShot X, Snagit

## Post-Processing

1. Add subtle drop shadow (makes it pop)
2. Round corners slightly (modern look)
3. Add device frame if desired (Screely, MockuPhone)
4. Ensure text is readable at mobile size
